# Bitbucket Diff Helper

Hides unwanted files diff to make Bitbucket's page more clear. Hides both summary of changed files and the inline diffs.

For now it supports hiding Unity-specific file extensions:

 - .ai
 - .anim
 - .asset
 - .controller
 - .eps
 - .jpg
 - .meta
 - .png
 - .prefab
 - .unity

Also, after hiding all of the files with specified extensions, it reloads inline diffs if some of them didn't load.
